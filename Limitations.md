Current limitations:

- Auto diameter for pads is _not_ taken from the board's design rules, but uses fixed values of min. 10 mil, 25%, max. 20 mil
- Texts are _not_ placed exactly at the correct position and are _not_ the exactly right size. This is because the app uses an iOS font and not EAGLE's built-in fonts.
