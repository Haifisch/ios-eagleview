- Find out why there are memory warnings when picking files from Dropbox
- New board file icon
- Nets/busses details popup
- Hit test for nets/busses
- Other pad shapes (incl. rotation/min/max/bounds calculations)
- Placeholder view when no schematic/board is selected
- Polygon signals fill – yikes :|
~ Fix patterened (not filled) rectangles (ROV TSC)
~ Fill patterns for layers (fill property on <layer>): http://www.raywenderlich.com/33496/core-graphics-tutorial-patterns
- Add Google Drive
- Improve single vs. double tap on iPhone
- Alternative to polygon fills: polygons on/off setting
- Speed up drawing by checking for relevant rect?
- Hit-test: ignore components on top/bottom if relevant layer not shown

~ Search for components


√ iPhone: Fix layers popup in portrait and when rotating
√ Settings switch to prevent sleep (app settings bundle)
√ Fix rotated attributes (Gift card SWD header) - turned out to be problem with 1) MR270 rotations and 2) not drawing non-attribute texts for smashed elements
√ Dropbox caching/remember last used path
√ Add file title label
÷ Semi-transparent signals (color)
√ Fix down-left jump when ending zoom
√ Maybe fix layer order drawing completely? (draw by hardcoded layer order)
√ Change to CATiledLayer to prevent memory issues when zooming in
√ Fix texts on schematic elements
√ Drawable: hole
√ Layers: read visibility from file
--- b6
√ Fix text rotation for compound rotations (e.g. Thermometer schematic's L1 and L2)
√ Fix arcs: e.g. US polarized caps (e.g. Thermometer)
√ iPhone: full-screen view
√ Add show/hide top/bottom layers from layers chooser view controller
√ iPad: part popup from component
--- b5
√ Layers: icon, show/hide selector
√ Auto-diameter for pads
√ Fix order of drawing on boards: bottom signals, bottom elements, top signals, top elements
√ Drawable: description (nope, this is info only, not a drawable)
√ Boards: signals
√ Drawable: via
√ Drawable: smd
√ Use bottom layers (place, name, value, stop, keepout, restrict etc.) for mirrored elements
√ Drawable: pad
√ iPhone
√ Fix instance hit test for rotated parts (e.g. USB connector in Gift Card)
√ Instance details popup
√ "Placeholder" texts >DRAWING_NAME, >LAST_DATE_TIME
√ Drawable: frame
√ Fix pin names with @ (e.g. "GND@2")
√ Pin names in symbols (U1 in Gift Card)
√ Mirrored components (Q1 in Gift Card) – NB: not text
√ Add icons to Dropbox chooser
√ Dropbox: Display .sch files in different style
√ Dropbox: Disable selecting non-sch files
√ Dropbox: remember last used folder
√ Fix zoom-to-fit (cuts off lines); add padding
√ Zoom around pinch center
√ Fix zoom: pinch=normal zoom; when ends, zoomScale is set (uses CATransform3D)
√ Implement "Open in…" functionality for .sch files
√ Implement "Open in…" functionality for .zip files
√ Animated zoom to fit
√ Dropbox + Document chooser
√ Attach progress HUD to Dropbox contents table instead of window
√ Fix loading sequence for Dropbox view controller
√ Handle schematics with negative coordinates (offset all)
√ Implement zoomToFit on schematic view
√ Fix rotation of texts when instance is rotated (text should still be right side up for 180° rotations)
√ Drawable: rectangle
√ Arcs in net/segment/wire or bus/segment/wire
√ Scroll
√ Zoom
√ Instrinsic content size on schematic view
