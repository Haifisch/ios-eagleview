To-do:

- Find out why there are memory warnings when picking files from Dropbox
- New board file icon
- Nets/busses details popup
- Hit test for nets/busses
- Other pad shapes (incl. rotation/min/max/bounds calculations)
- Polygon signals fill – yikes :|
- Improve single vs. double tap on iPhone
- Alternative to polygon fills: polygons on/off setting
- Speed up drawing by checking for relevant rect?
- Search: deselect all marked components
- Fix text drawing of R270 rotated instances
- Fix bounding rect of R270 rotated instances
- Fix too long texts in detail popup view controller
- UI: launch screen
- Implement search UI for iPhone
- Add padding to auto-size bounding rect
- Fix the goddamn zoom-to-fit!


------------------------
In progress/partly done:

~ Sheets
~ Fix patterened (not filled) rectangles (e.g. ROV TSC)
~ Fill patterns for layers (fill property on <layer>): http://www.raywenderlich.com/33496/core-graphics-tutorial-patterns

Done:

√ Hit-test: ignore components on top/bottom if relevant layer not shown
√ Fixed initial state of toolbar buttons
√ Fixed initial file loading
--- b142
√ Disable sheets picker if there is only one sheet/module or if it's a board file
√ Fix part info popup location on iPhone
√ Automatically open last file
√ Placeholder view when no schematic/board is selected
√ UI: double tap on module instance -> show module (first sheet)
√ New Dropbox and zoom-to-fit icons
√ UI: table separator widths on iPhone. Weird flickering? (fixed by http://stackoverflow.com/a/26643417)
√ iOS 8: fix deprecation warnings
√ Update to deployment target 8.0
√ UI: space between search/sheets/layers buttons
√ Search in instance/element values also
√ Modules
--- b7
√ Update Dropbox API?
√ Add "Unlink" to Dropbox to sign in as a different user
√ Fix content height in Dropbox picker view controller
√ Dropbox: fix path when loading last used path from user defaults
√ Search for components
√ Allow user to choose which file to open from zip archive
√ Open board files
√ Fixed highlight of MR90 parts (bounding rect)
÷ Add Google Drive
√ iPhone: Fix layers popup in portrait and when rotating
√ Settings switch to prevent sleep (app settings bundle)
√ Fix rotated attributes (Gift card SWD header) - turned out to be problem with 1) MR270 rotations and 2) not drawing non-attribute texts for smashed elements
√ Dropbox caching/remember last used path
√ Add file title label
÷ Semi-transparent signals (color)
√ Fix down-left jump when ending zoom
√ Maybe fix layer order drawing completely? (draw by hardcoded layer order)
√ Change to CATiledLayer to prevent memory issues when zooming in
√ Fix texts on schematic elements
√ Drawable: hole
√ Layers: read visibility from file
--- b6
√ Fix text rotation for compound rotations (e.g. Thermometer schematic's L1 and L2)
√ Fix arcs: e.g. US polarized caps (e.g. Thermometer)
√ iPhone: full-screen view
√ Add show/hide top/bottom layers from layers chooser view controller
√ iPad: part popup from component
--- b5
√ Layers: icon, show/hide selector
√ Auto-diameter for pads
√ Fix order of drawing on boards: bottom signals, bottom elements, top signals, top elements
√ Drawable: description (nope, this is info only, not a drawable)
√ Boards: signals
√ Drawable: via
√ Drawable: smd
√ Use bottom layers (place, name, value, stop, keepout, restrict etc.) for mirrored elements
√ Drawable: pad
√ iPhone
√ Fix instance hit test for rotated parts (e.g. USB connector in Gift Card)
√ Instance details popup
√ "Placeholder" texts >DRAWING_NAME, >LAST_DATE_TIME
√ Drawable: frame
√ Fix pin names with @ (e.g. "GND@2")
√ Pin names in symbols (U1 in Gift Card)
√ Mirrored components (Q1 in Gift Card) – NB: not text
√ Add icons to Dropbox chooser
√ Dropbox: Display .sch files in different style
√ Dropbox: Disable selecting non-sch files
√ Dropbox: remember last used folder
√ Fix zoom-to-fit (cuts off lines); add padding

√ Fix zoom: pinch=normal zoom; when ends, zoomScale is set (uses CATransform3D)
√ Implement "Open in…" functionality for .sch files
√ Implement "Open in…" functionality for .zip files
√ Animated zoom to fit
√ Dropbox + Document chooser
√ Attach progress HUD to Dropbox contents table instead of window
√ Fix loading sequence for Dropbox view controller
√ Handle schematics with negative coordinates (offset all)
√ Implement zoomToFit on schematic view
√ Fix rotation of texts when instance is rotated (text should still be right side up for 180° rotations)
√ Drawable: rectangle
√ Arcs in net/segment/wire or bus/segment/wire
√ Scroll
√ Zoom
√ Instrinsic content size on schematic view
